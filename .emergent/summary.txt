<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants a program for Ubuntu that performs two main functions:
1.  Extract all historical winning numbers for the Romanian Loto 5/40.
2.  Analyze the historical data to find a seed or a mathematical formula that can predict future winning numbers.

Over the course of the conversation, the requirements evolved significantly:
- The initial idea of a simple seed was replaced with finding the *formula that generates the sequence of seeds* for each draw.
- The user requested that the analysis be computationally intensive, designed to run on powerful multi-core CPU and GPU machines.
- The goal shifted from finding a 100% perfect predictive formula to finding a pragmatic or good enough pattern that could predict a subset of the numbers (e.g., 3-4 out of 6) with a high success rate (~70-80%) over a long history (10-20 years).
- The user requested the system be adaptable for other lotteries, specifically Loto 6/49 and Joker.

**User's preferred language**: Romanian

**what currently exists?**
A collection of Python command-line scripts located in . There is no frontend or database. The system provides a toolset for:
- Scraping historical lottery data for Loto 5/40 from .
- An extensive library () implementing 18 different types of Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) for testing.
- Scripts to perform exhaustive searches for seeds and mathematical patterns in the sequence of seeds that could explain the historical draws.
- A CPU-optimized script () using Python's  for high-performance calculations.
- A pragmatic pattern finder () that searches for the best-fit, imperfect predictive model with the highest success rate over time, as per the user's latest request.
- Multiple  files documenting the various stages and functionalities of the developed scripts.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user asked if adjustments were needed to make the system work for Loto 6/49 and Joker. The agent confirmed this was possible and was about to begin creating adapted versions of the scripts for these other lotteries.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: manual testing by curl
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues. The work is proceeding based on iterative feature requests from the user.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Adapt the system for Loto 6/49 (P0)**
    - **Where to resume**: Create a new set of scripts or modify existing ones to handle the 6/49 number range (1-49) and draw format. The scraper  will likely need modification to target the correct data source for 6/49 on .
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The user will be able to run the same pragmatic pattern analysis on the Loto 6/49 lottery.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

- **Task 2: Adapt the system for Joker (P1)**
    - **Where to resume**: Similar to the 6/49 task, create or adapt scripts for the Joker lottery format, which has a different structure (5/45 + 1/20). The scraper will need significant adjustments for this.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: The user will be able to run the analysis on the Joker lottery.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: backend
    - **Blocked on something**: None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- No future tasks have been explicitly defined by the user beyond the current request to adapt the system for other lotteries.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Web Scraper**: Created  to fetch historical Loto 5/40 data.
- **Initial Analysis Scripts**: Developed basic scripts for frequency analysis (, ), which were later superseded by more advanced requests.
- **Exhaustive Seed/Formula Finder**: Built a comprehensive system to test 18 different PRNG algorithms against historical data to find predictive patterns (, ).
- **High-Performance Optimization**: Implemented a multi-process CPU-optimized version () for faster analysis.
- **Pragmatic Pattern Finder**: Created  to search for good enough predictive models that don't require a 100% match, aligning with the user's latest clarified goal.
- **Documentation**: Generated multiple README files explaining the purpose and usage of the different script sets.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. The agent successfully addressed all issues raised by the user during the session, including correcting wrong probability calculations and iteratively refining the scripts to match the user's evolving understanding of their own request.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- N/A

**Code Architecture**
The project consists entirely of backend scripts. There is no frontend, database, or API.


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Web Scraping**: Using  and  to parse HTML and extract data.
- **Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs)**: Implementing and testing various PRNG algorithms (LCG, Xorshift, Mersenne Twister, etc.).
- **Reverse Engineering**: The core concept of trying to find the initial state (seed) and algorithm of a system based on its outputs.
- **High-Performance Computing**: Using Python's  library for parallel execution on multi-core CPUs.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Using  for pattern fitting and analyzing sequences of data.

**key DB schema**
- N/A. Data is scraped live or read from a temporarily saved JSON file ().

**changes in tech stack**
- None. The project was built from scratch using Python. The  library was added during the session.

**All files of reference**
- **/app/backend/loto_scraper.py**: Fetches historical lottery data, essential for all other scripts.
- **/app/backend/advanced_rng_library.py**: The core library containing 18 different PRNG implementations. This is the heart of the analysis.
- **/app/backend/pragmatic_pattern_finder.py**: The main script that implements the user's current best-fit analysis goal.
- **/app/backend/README_PRAGMATIC_APPROACH.md**: The documentation for the current primary script.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The project has a large number of overlapping scripts created through iterative development. It could be significantly refactored into a single, configurable command-line application. For example, a single  could take arguments like  or  to avoid code duplication and simplify maintenance. The numerous README files could also be consolidated into one comprehensive document.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User's Goal**: The user is on an experimental journey to test the predictability of real-world lotteries. They are technically inclined and want powerful tools for this purpose. Your role is to build these tools as requested, while implicitly demonstrating (through the scripts' outputs) the statistical unlikelihood of finding a truly predictive pattern.
- **Current Focus**: The primary task is to adapt the existing pragmatic pattern finder for Loto 6/49 and Joker. The earlier scripts for 100% matches are now less relevant.
- **Modularity is Key**: When adapting the scripts for new lotteries, ensure the core logic (RNG library, pattern finding) remains separate from the lottery-specific configuration (number range, numbers to draw, data source URL). This will make future adaptations easier.

**documents created in this job**
- Multiple markdown files in  including:
